KayleeAnne. \n\nEverything she did from the beginning of this ordeal had to be engineered (whether consciously or not) to ruin my cousin's day. \n\nShe \"lost\" three hundred dollars worth of booze before the engagement party. She got drunk at the lingerie party and tried on some of my cousin's really expensive brand new lingerie. Like I almost considered taking her to small claims court because I found the four pairs of La Perla panties I bought my cousin on the bathroom floor after Kaylee fucking Anne had trashed them... With a bunch of other stuff. There was a handmade corset in the tub too. I can't remember who gave my cousin that but it was custom. She brought coke to the bachelorette party (hey, I'm not fucking complaining) but she was really fucking obnoxious about it. She kept telling people we had it, oh my god I thought we were going to get arrested. There are so many things she did at the showers/fittings/brunches/parties we had. \n\nThe night before the wedding she got really really drunk and told me and the MOH she loved her brother and felt like she was losing her family... Take that as you will. The next day was a comedy of errors. KayleeAnne woke up really hung over and I gave her a bloody Mary and told her to get her ass in gear... I was just not in the mood to deal with her whining and I hadn't seen my own husband in like 48hours and I kind of need him to center me sometimes. So I thought whatever hair of the dog, she'll be OK. No. She got drunk. Like puking drunk. I found out later she had drank way more vodka than that weak bloody Mary I made her after I left our room (yeah, I volunteered to room with her) to meet the dudes with the tables downstairs. KayleeAnne had a \"coughing fit\" during the ceremony. She also \"tripped\" twice while walking down the aisle. Later the groomsman told me she totally pulled away from him and fell on purpose. \n\nIt was a total mess. She really doesn't like me either. I started calling her KA immediately after meeting her and I told her she looked like she smoked. According to my cousin, KA still calls me \"that fat alcoholic cunt\". I am not fat or an alcoholic. The last time I saw her, I pretended to forget her name. I called her KelseyAnne. \n\nAnyways, thankfully my sweet, awesome cousin did not let KA bother her and she had a good time on her special day.

Her cousin, aunt's daughter, was one of her brides maids.  Well when we all went to the store to find dresses, all she did was complain and say how everything that my friend picked out would look horrible on her daughter, and she should know what works best because she was a seamstress, and she should pick THIS dress, and blah blah.  So my friend, of course, puts up with NONE of it.  She tells her if she continues to act this way, her daughter will NOT be in the wedding.  It is her wedding and this is what she wants.  Aunt shut up for the most part, kept muttering and what not about what a horrible choice she made for brides maids dresses.  She wanted her daughter to have one size, but it was too small, so my friend said, \"Well, if she doesn't fit in the dress on my wedding day, she won't be in the wedding.  Since you are a master seamstress and you don't want to pay for alterations, get the bigger one and alter it yourself.\"  Needless to say, the larger dress was ordered, yet on the wedding day, no alterations were made, and we all had to McGyver her dress so it didn't fall off.  Also, said aunt insisted that she make all the boutineers and bouquets.  So she had a mock up that she showed my friend, and all she had asked of her was to have everything done a week before the wedding.  Yea...didn't happen.  She showed up late so none of the flowers were in the pictures.  Luckily my friend liked them, otherwise I think her aunt's body would have been found later out back.  Oh also, when we were all helping to set up the venue she was an absolute nightmare.  Two instances were we were she was tasked with putting a tablecloth on the dj table.  She taped it to the front.  I shit you not.  I took it off and put it on right, making sure that it draped to cover the whole front of the table to the ground.  Another was the card cage (bird cage where you put your cards, looks cute).  There was some ivy that my friend wanted to look nice with the cage.  She took it and just flopped it around the bottom of the cage on the table.  I too fixed it, tucking it up and around the bars, making it look decent instead of half-assed.  \n\nI've helped photograph a wedding before and the maid of honor couldn't be arsed to show up for pictures before the wedding, so we took them without her.  Bride was really chill about it, didn't bat an eye.  She showed up before the ceremony and was doing her makeup while we finished photos.  She wasn't in any of the photos.  \n\nLast one, my sister's friend got married.  Oh, this was...wow.  So the friend's mom and sister were tasked with making bookmarks that would be handed out.  They had a month to do it, small-ish wedding, like under 150 people.  They still weren't done the night before the wedding.  Then they got pissed when their grandmother tasked us with helping to get them done.  The friend's sister's baby-daddy kept calling my sister's friend's cell phone because her sister didn't have one, because he was mad she was out of state (he couldn't come because probation).

What wasn't fine was that she basically abandoned her 6mo old baby on us for a few weeks. We kicked her out, she took forever to get her stuff, we kept her sweet TV and her grandmother's antique dining room table (and gave it away to someone a few months ago).  This was 5 years ago.\n\nAnother was because I didn't \"approve of his lifestyle\" - he was a male in a female's body. We called him Blaine, used male pronouns like he wanted, and we even let him move in with us for a short while because he needed some space from his parents.  We let his girlfriend come over and stay with him while we were on our honeymoon.  But somehow we just didn't approve of his lifestyle...*eyeroll*\n\nAnother one is a good friend of Blaine ^^^ - she didn't like that I didn't follow her dramatic, tumblr views about certain things. Ex: I fucking love Chik-fil-A and Dominos, but because they're owned by \"christian assholes\", apparently I support their views by eating their food. She actually told me she thinks less of me because I eat there. Fuck you, i love their food, and i'm not changing.  Blaine and this lady were actually in our wedding party, interestingly enough.  Our falling out with them was about...5 months after our wedding?  I have a few stories about this bitch taking advantage of us and being rude, and being kind of a cunt about things.\n\nAnother set of friends (a couple named Dan and Kara) got all bent out of shape about a story my husband told me in our apartment with an open window.  We lived on the third floor.  Dan had to be listening *hard* to hear the story.  Bill (husband) was telling me how his friend told him he \"could totally fuck Kara\", and Bill laughed and said he told his friend, \"dude Kara would fuck you up...don't even think about that shit.\"  Well Dan heard this, bowed up on Bill and was all, \"I don't appreciate you talking about my wife like that\", to which we laughed and were confused because...we didn't say anything disrespectful?  So we get him to drop it, and go back to his apartment across the hall.  A few days later, Kara confronts me about the story, says we are lying and that Dan told her the truth (which, obviously, he told her a twisted version of the story), and that was pretty much it.\n\nAll of this was in the past 5 years.

I happen to be a straight male, who was college age at the time. Several my female friends had stories of going to the same clinic for PAP smears, breast exams, and birth control (we were poor college students and the cost of medical care in the U.S. was/is insane) and being screamed at by a phalanx of angry people, mostly men. Regardless of where I stood on the issue of abortion, I thought being terrorized on the way to get medical care was cruel and insane. \n\nI mentioned to Bob that, as a gay male who was out, he might want to rethink actively protesting in such a fashion. I tried to explain to him how the women I knew who went to the clinic did so for basic medical exams, and not abortions. I pointed out that the community Bob belonged to regularly had suffered terribly at the hands of less-tolerant people and outright homophobes. This was a long time before Matthew Shepard, in fact. I also reminded Bob the religious zealots who he protested with also had a deep hatred for gay people. \n\nBob lost his shit. He simply wouldn't see the connection or irony between actively terrorizing women alongside people who would be happy to see he himself being terrorized for his sexual preferences. Bob unleashed personal attacks on me, with serious venom spewed in letters and emails. I was shocked at the hatred for me coming from a friend I always accepted as he was. We were close buds, but it was like some fucking Star Wars movie where you discover someone you trusted was actually a dark Sith lord. I'm not kidding. Night and day behavior. I wrote him one last time to tell him I would've happily kept our feelings about abortion private and continued our friendship, but since he really crossed the line with the personal attacks, I now knew how he felt about me, despite what I thought was a close friendship.\n\nFor about eight years after I ended my association with him, Bob sent me emails and mailed me newspaper clippings when my career made the news. I missed him for a long time afterwards, but to know that he had stored up such bile for me while continuing along with a completely different personality was just too creepy.
